# PitchPerfect
An iOS app to record audio and augment playback.

This project was completed for the [Udacity Intro to iOS App Development](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud585).

If you're in that course or a related course right now, obey all honor code requirements before viewing this code.  
I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
